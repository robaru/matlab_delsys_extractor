## Overview

I have found the Delsys mat files difficult to use, so I have coded this small function to help me create a data structure that is easier to handle.

**Features**

- Prepares and resamples mat files generated from Delsys file utility software
- Simplifies the data structure for easier analysis
- Simple plotting function for inspection

## Usage

To use this function, call it with the path to your Delsys mat file as shown in `test_extract_delsys`. The function will return a resampled and simplified data structure.

The result will be something like this:
